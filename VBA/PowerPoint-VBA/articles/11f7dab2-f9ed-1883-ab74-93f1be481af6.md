# Timing Object (PowerPoint)

Represents timing properties for an animation effect.


## Remarks

Use the following read/write properties of the  **Timing** object to manipulate animation timing effects.



|**Use this property**|**To change this...**|
|:-----|:-----|
|[Accelerate](3e1a7b53-e398-e814-56ed-9df19bb26a0d.md)|Percentage of the duration over which acceleration should take place|
|[AutoReverse](82137189-a7f0-bacc-0550-41c9b5ff9ded.md)|Whether an effect should play forward and then reverse, thereby doubling the duration|
|[Decelerate](3bf6fc1b-8f14-ef9a-cf70-69a93729f5bf.md)|Percentage of the duration over which deceleration should take place|
|[Duration](f8c47dda-9687-e437-8038-dae11c022914.md)|Length of animation (in seconds)|
|[RepeatCount](71d31607-6006-f2c0-cfa3-3711791331bc.md)|Number of times to repeat the animation|
|[RepeatDuration](8c69f0a7-224a-db67-2a94-0237f55f184e.md)|How long should the repeats last (in seconds)|
|[Restart](0dd82d15-aa92-1de9-6406-957710c26fb6.md)|Restart behavior of an animation node|
|[RewindAtEnd](2055f5aa-10d4-45a7-f25d-afaa924f0937.md)|Whether an objects return to its beginning position after an effect has ended|
|[SmoothStart](7e2f3578-7367-748d-7e3c-cd4643a71e9d.md)|Whether an effect accelerates when it starts|
|[SmoothEnd](4d5d746b-ed5f-e708-287f-62e02684040c.md)|Whether an effect decelerates when it ends|
|[TriggerDelayTime](4d14ffb0-e966-4708-ba30-4a9a1fe34766.md)|Delay time from when the trigger is enabled (in seconds)|
|[TriggerShape](0b9431d2-0cea-d279-4aa7-24dd145e987e.md)|Which shape is associated with the timing effect|
|[TriggerType](a868c747-6088-df48-3c93-50f4ab24ae85.md)|How the timing effect is triggered|

## Example

To return a  **Timing** object, use the[Timing](343f11d4-04bf-2637-dbbc-dc3256d57940.md)property of the  **[AnimationBehavior](70eeb4aa-b9ba-ff7d-93ee-425cf191a6cb.md)** or **[Effect](359ac3da-86cd-8003-d691-349d20fd1777.md)** object. The following example sets timing duration information for the main animation.


```vb
ActiveWindow.Selection.SlideRange(1).TimeLine.MainSequence(1).Timing.Duration = 5
```
